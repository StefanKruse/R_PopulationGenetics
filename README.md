# R_PopulationGenetics
Functions for fast forward population genetic analyses in R. Most functions are based on genind-objects, which is the adegenet formal class (S4) for individual genotypes. 

Among others, it includes functions for:
- calculating summaries, e.g. number of alleles, allele distribution of single loci
- estimating linkage disequilibrium
- reformatting genind-objects to formats required by other programs, e.g. BOTTLENECK, GENEPOP, FreeNA, ARLEQUIN, STRUCTURE, EEMS, SPAGEDI, TESS, CERVUS

These functions were compiled/developed during the analyses of microsatellite data for the manuscript: "High gene flow and complex treeline dynamics of Larix Mill. stands on the Taymyr Peninsula (north-central Siberia) revealed by nuclear microsatellites"
